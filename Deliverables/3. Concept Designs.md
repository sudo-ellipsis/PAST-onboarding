## Onboarding 4.3 Deliverable 3: Concept Design Outlines
### Connor Major

This document outlines three basic concept designs for a Cubesat structure that meet JAXA requirements. The concepts are not fully annotated as they are only rough drafts

This design uses a full stack of PCB's enclosed by a bent-metal frame. Instead of using a single square element at the corners, the design would use a bent-metal corner, with tabs added to achieve the connection points at the corners in the reference design.
requires metal bending?

This design would screw the PCB's onto their own metal frames. This would be a square with externally protruding corners to meet rail dimensions, with rectangular prisms extending vertically from the sides as in the reference design. Each PCB would be stacked as per previous designs. The PCB frames would be a structural element, with the PCB's seperated by an o-ring to avoid buckling or load. The primary idea was to reduce all external structure as much as possible, with only rails.

This concept blends the previous two designs, and builds upon the two. The primary idea behind this design is to use bolted bent metal tabs, which hold a stack of PCB's as a non-structural element. 
The primary idea was to vastly simplify the 

## Selection methods

Each design is intended to fit the JAXA requirements. However, some other requirements or goals were imposed by the design document.The design needed to be manufacturable. It needed to be disassembled, reassembled, leverage COTS parts where possible, and provide mounting for other, non PCB parts. It also needed to be modular and allow for later design changes. It also needed to be simpler than the current design to justify being worked on.

I ranked these criteria, before assessing my designs:
1. Must be manufacturable (to be achieved at all)
2. Must be simpler than current design (to justify engineering effort)
3. Must be capable of disassembly/reassembly
4. Must leverage COTS parts
5. Must provide mounting for other parts
6. Must limit fasteners

I ended up selecting design 3. It had the easiest method of manufacture, as it leveraged almost all bent metal parts. As it didn't required CNC work, it was simpler than the current design. It did use a large number of bolted connections, which hwould slow disassembly but not make it prohibitive. It used the same level of COTS parts as previous designs, but the bent metal allowed for laser cutting and bending by an external supplier if required.
